title: TLS Certificates
---

{{ PRODUCT }} requires a TLS certificate hosted on our network to serve HTTPS traffic. 

-   **Auto-Generated Domains:** {{ PRODUCT }} provides a wildcard TLS certificate that covers your property's auto-generated domains.

    **Sample domain:** `<TEAM>-<PROPERTY>-<BRANCH>-<VERSION>.layer0-limelight.link`

-   **Your Hostnames:** You may either:

    -   [Allow {{ PRODUCT }} to [autogenerate a TLS certificate for each of your hostnames.](#autogenerating-tls-certificates)
    -   [Upload your own TLS certificate.](#uploading-your-certificate)

### Autogenerating TLS Certificates {/*autogenerating-tls-certificates*/}

{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} can automatically generate TLS Certificates on your behalf using [_Let's Encrypt_](https://letsencrypt.org/). Autogenerated certificates are free, valid for 3 months, and automatically renewed as long as the following technical requirements remain met:

-   [Hostnames:](/guides/basics/hostnames-and-origins#hostnames) Register the hostnames that will serve traffic for each environment.
-   [Certificate Authority Authorization:](#certificate-authority-authorization) The Let's Encrypt certificate authority (CA) must be allowed to issue certificates for each registered hostname. 
-   [Domain Control Validation:](#domain-control-validation) Prove your control over that domain by adding an `_acme-challenge` CNAME record to it.

#### Certificate Authority Authorization

The Let's Encrypt certificate authority (CA) must be allowed to issue certificates for each registered hostname. It is allowed to issue certificates when either of the following conditions are true:

-   A CAA record has not been issued for that hostname or a parent hostname. This DNS configuration means that any CA is allowed to generate certificates for that hostname.
-   A CAA record explicitly allows the Let's Encrypt CA to generate certificates for that hostname. 

    This sample CAA record indicates that the Let's Encrypt CA is allowed to issue certificates for `cdn.example.com`:

    `cdn.example.com.   CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`

**To add a CAA record to allow Let's Encrypt to generate certificates for your domains**

1.  Verify the value of the CAA records for your domain from the command line.

    ```bash
    # Run the following command
    dig caa +short <your-apex-domain>

    # Example
    dig caa +short mywebsite.xyz
    ```

    Example of a CAA query showing that only specific CAs are allowed to generate certificates for that domain:

    ```bash
    0 issue "amazon.com"
    0 issue "digicert.com"
    0 issue "globalsign.com"
    0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
    ```

    If the result of the CAA DNS query is empty, it means that any CA is allowed to generate certificates on that domain. If so, proceed to [domain control validation](#domain-control-validation).

2.  If there are `CAA` DNS entries defined on your domain and if the Let's Encrypt's CAA entry is not among those, you will have to add an additional `CAA` entry for Let's Encrypt.

    To do so, log into your DNS provider, and add a `CAA` type DNS record with the following values:

       -   **Type:** `CAA`
       -   **Name:** empty or `@` (depending on the DNS provider)
       -   **Flags:** `0`
       -   **Tag:** `issue`
       -   **Value:** `letsencrypt.org` or `"letsencrypt.org"`

    **GoDaddy Example:**
   
    ![CAA Record on GoDaddy](/images/production/godaddy-caa.jpg)

    **Gandi Example:**

    ![CAA Record on Gandi](/images/production/gandi-caa.jpg)

    You can use the following links to see how to configure the CAA record on commonly used DNS providers:

        - [Entrust CAA Lookup](https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/tools/caa-lookup)

   <Callout type="info">

      Many DNS providers have already added this `CAA` DNS record by default while some DNS providers do not allow the creation of `CAA` DNS records and therefore allow any CA to generate certificates.

      Learn more about CAA DNS records through the following websites: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://docs.gandi.net/en/domain_names/faq/record_types/caa_record.html">Gandi</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/technical-deep-dive-securing-automation-acme-dns-challenge-validation">eff.org</a>

   </Callout>

#### Domain Control Validation

Before {{ PRODUCT }} to issue a certificate request on your behalf, we require that you validate your control over each of your hostnames by adding a CNAME record.  From your DNS service provider, add the following CNAME DNS entry for each desired hostname:

-   **Host:** `_acme-challenge.<HOSTNAME>`

    **Example:** 

    If your hostname is `cdn.example.com`, then you would set it to `_acme-challenge.cdn.example.com`.

-   **Value:** `_acme-challenge.xdn-validation.com`

**GoDaddy Example:**

![ACME Challenge Record on GoDady](/images/production/godaddy-acme-challenge.jpg)

**Gandi Example:**

![ACME Challenge Record on Gandi](/images/production/gandi-acme-challenge.jpg)

Once the DNS entries have been added, verify your configuration:

-   [MX ToolBox DNS Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx)
-   [NsLookup DNS Lookup](https://www.nslookup.io/dns-checker/)
-   Command line: 

    ```bash
    # Run the following 'dig' command to verify the presence of the '_acme-challenge.' CNAME :
    dig +short cname _acme-challenge.<your-domain>
 
    # For example:
    dig +short cname _acme-challenge.mywebsite.xyz
    ```

    Expected result for the DNS query:

    ```
    _acme-challenge.xdn-validation.com.
    ```

If you use multiple domains for your website, like `mywebsite.xyz` and `www.mywebsite.xyz`, you will have to make sure that the `_acme-challenge` DNS record has been added for both domains:

```
_acme-challenge.mywebsite.xyz -> _acme-challenge.xdn-validation.com.
_acme-challenge.www.mywebsite.xyz -> _acme-challenge.xdn-validation.com.
```

If you have previously used Let's Encrypt to generate certificates for your hostnames, you should verify that all `_acme-challenge.<HOSTNAME>` TXT records have been removed.

#### TLS Certificate Verification

Once the requirements above are met, you should verify that a TLS certificate for each of your hostnames has been generated.

**To verify TLS certificate creation**

1.  From the {{ PORTAL }}, click **Settings** to load the **Settings** page. Find the **TLS Certificate** section.
2.  Review the TLS status for each of your hostnames.

    ![TLS Certificate section](/images/security/tls-certificate)

3.  If a TLS certificate has not yet been generated, you may manually generate it by clicking <img data-inline-img src="/images/icons/recheck-validation.png" alt="Recheck Validation icon" /> under the **ACME Challenge Record** column.
4. {{ PRODUCT }} will generate a TLS certificate for that hostname within a few minutes.

### Manually Creating a TLS Certificate {/*creating-a-certificate-manually*/}

<Callout type="info">

   Skip this section if you plan on using autogenerated TLS certificate or if you already have an existing TLS certificate that you plan to [upload](#uploading-your-certificate). 

</Callout>

TLS certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA) based on a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that they receive from you. Although the same process generates a CSR and a private key, you should only share your CSR with the CA. You should securely store your private key.

The following steps describe the creation of the CSR and private key with OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an open-source toolkit for the TLS protocol. We recommend using OpenSSL because it ensures that your private key will only be stored locally on your infrastructure. Your CA may have more customized guides or an entirely customized certification process.

**To generate a CSR and a private key**

1.  From the command line, verify that OpenSSL is installed:
    -   **MacOS:** Install it by using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) package manager (e.g., `brew install openssl`).
    -   **Windows:** Install it by using [`Chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager (e.g., `choco install openssl`).
    -   **Linux/Unix:** Install it by running the built-in OS package manager (e.g., `apt-get install openssl`, `apk add openssl`, and so on).

2. Go to the directory of your choice and create a configuration file `{{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.conf` based on this template:

    ```
    [req]
    default_bits=2048
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    req_extensions = v3_req

    [req_distinguished_name]
    countryName=Country Name (2 letter code)
    countryName_default=US
    stateOrProvinceName=State or Province Name (full name)
    stateOrProvinceName_default=California
    localityName=Locality Name (e.g., city)
    localityName_default=San Francisco
    organizationName=Organization Name (e.g., company)
    organizationName_default=YourCompanyName
    commonName=Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) e.g., www.your-company-name.com
    commonName_default=www.your-company-domain.com

    [ v3_req ]
    subjectAltName=@alt_names

    [alt_names] # Other domains: apex domain, wildcard domain for staging and dev, and so on
    DNS.1=*.your-main-domain.com
    DNS.2=*.your-dev-domain.com
    DNS.3=your-apex-domain.com
    # And so on
    ```

    Replace the country, state/province, locality, organization name, and Common Name (CN). Set the CN to your hostname's fully qualified domain name (e.g., `cdn.example.com`).

    {{ PRODUCT }} strongly encourages the use of wildcard certificates. However, if you are not using a wildcard certificate, then you will need to add the remaining hostnames into the `alt_names` section.

3.  Run the following command:

    ```
    openssl req -out {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.key -config {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.conf -batch
    ```

    This should generate your CSR in `{{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.csr` and private key in `{{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.key`. 

    <Callout type="info">

      If you want OpenSSL to ask you for each different input, remove the `-batch` option and re-run the command.

    </Callout>

4.  Verify your CSR contains the expected domains by running the following command:

    ```
    openssl req -in {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.csr -noout -text | grep DNS
    ```

5.  Read the CSR (e.g., `cat {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.csr`) or copy it to your clipboard (on OSX, `cat {{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}.csr | pbcopy`) and send it to your CA for certification.

### Uploading Your Certificate {/*uploading-your-certificate*/}

Uploading a TLS certificate requires:

-   An Enterprise account.  {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}
-   The **Admin** role within your team
-   A certificate issued by a CA
-   The intermediate certificates (IC) used by the CA, including the CA's signing certificate
-   The private key that was generated with the CSR.

**To upload your TLS certificate**

1.  From the {{ PORTAL }}, click **Settings** to load the **Settings** page. Find the **TLS Certificate** section.
2.  Clear the **Automatically create an TLS certificate for my custom domains.** option.
3.  Copy the certificate, intermediate certificates, and the private key into the corresponding options.

    <Callout type="info">

      The private key is non-public data and must not be shared with parties other than {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}. {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} securely stores your private key. It is never shown in the developer console and it is only used to provision parts of the infrastructure that are used to terminate TLS connections.

    </Callout>

5.  Click **Changes Saved**.

    After which, the status of the TLS certificate will update to *Activating*.

    ![in-progress-certificate](/images/production/in-progress-certificate.png)

    After the certificate is activated, its status becomes *Active*.

    ![activated-certificate](/images/production/activated-certificate.png)

    <Callout type="info">

      Certificate activation should take a few minutes. Contact technical customer support if the status does not become *Active* within an hour.

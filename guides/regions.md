# XDN regions

## Architecture

Moovweb XDN has multiple global regions in which it will automatically:

* provision compute resources that run your code in two geographically close but entirely separate data centers (see [high availability](overview#section_high_availability))
* provision level 2 cache to maximize the global cache hit rate and reduces traffic to your servers

## Regions

Moovweb XDN is available in the following global regions:

* Americas: Eastern US and Western US
* Europe: Ireland, UK, Western Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe
* Asia: Japan
* Oceania: Australia

When you are en Enterprise customer, you can choose in which region you want your workloads to run. If you have particular needs, other regions may be configured specifically for you.

For all Free Tier customers all workloads run in Eastern US region.
